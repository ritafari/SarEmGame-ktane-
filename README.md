# SarEmGame-ktane-

Welcome to the **SarEm** game! This is a timed puzzle game where you need to solve a series of modules within each level to prevent the bomb from exploding. Each incorrect answer or timeout adds a strike, and accumulating three strikes results in a game over. Solve all levels to successfully defuse the bomb and win the game!

## Game Objective

Solve puzzles in a limited time across three levels to defuse the bomb. Each level has unique challenges and a stricter time limit than the previous one. Correct answers bring you closer to defusing the bomb, while incorrect answers or timeouts add to your strikes.

- **Levels**: 3
- **Strikes Allowed**: 3 (Three strikes result in a game over)
- **Time Limits**:
  - **Level 1**: 30 seconds per puzzle
  - **Level 2**: 20 seconds per puzzle
  - **Level 3**: 15 seconds per puzzle
